			<p>As of January 2025, I have been working through The Odin Project, which is an open source coding curriculum meant to help develop coding skills and practices suited for a full stack developer. As such the curriculum provides many hands on projects designed to help me grow as a developer and familiarize myself with the practices and technologies I may not have come across in a formal classroom setting.</p>

		<p>I'm in the process of converting most of my School Projects on here to run via GitHub Pages so not all projects will run via this website. Instead I'll link to the repository where I've kept and sorted my classwork by class and school year.</p>
