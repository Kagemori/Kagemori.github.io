				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<br />
				<p>My name is Keith Estrella and this is my little part of the web! I graduated from Kean University and have been studying computer programming first through Machine Learning and recently I've picked up Web Development.
				Don't mind me as I try and put what I've studied to use in the making of this website. Odds are I may make a mistake or two as I continue practicing my programming skills on here. :D</p>

				<h1>How to navigate!</h1>
				<br />
				<p>My site is split up into predominantly 3 main webpages, School Projects, Personal Projects and my Resume. Use the links in the top right to look at which one's that interest you. As I mentioned before this is a bit of a work in progress as I continue learning. But who knows if you happen across this site again it may be way different!</p>
