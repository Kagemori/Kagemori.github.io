            <h3>Master Thesis: Optimization of Facial Detection</h3>
            <p>Master Thesis on object detection, how as a programmer entering such a field can begin the machine learning pipeline of collecting and cleaning data for training, the various models that can be used for training an object dection model and the pros and cons of each kind. I had used Kaggle to collect my dataset and if the model could not use the dataset, manually clean the set to be properly used for training. The main 3 models I focused on were Detectron2, Darknet and DETR, using the WIDERFACE, FDDB and CrowdHuman datasets.</p><br>

This project started with using a video game data set from Kaggle and creating a clustering algorithm to generate a "recommendation" list of games a user could enjoy playing based on what they have played previously and their personal rating of how much they liked the game.</p>

        <p>I'm in the process of converting most of my School Projects on here to run via GitHub Pages so not all projects will run via this website. Instead I'll link to the repository where I've kept and sorted my classwork by class and school year.</p>
